    <p> My hobby is playing Freestyle Football. It requires a lot of skill and patience. Whenever I come home I always play Football, even if it is raining I will play in my basement. I am 12 years old and I am in 6th grade. I started playing Freestyle Football when I was 10. You do a lot of crazy tricks with the ball when doing it. Here is a further more detailed discription of what freestyle football is. Freestyle football, also known as freestyle soccer in North America, is the art of self-expression through creatively juggling a football using any parts of the body, excluding the elbows to the hands. It combines football tricks, dance, acrobatics and music to entertain onlookers and compete with opponents. The picture above is someone I watch on youtube. His name is Jack Downer. His youtube name is Street Panna. He is the person who got me in to freestyle football. Please subscribe to him. Here is his link: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCZAwf7HgsIQXyx6tNgK2dgQ </p>
